          <h2>Sobre a universibar</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Sintetic words</strong>, or <em>lipsum</em> as it is sometimes
            known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web
            designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the
            15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De
            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.
          </p>
          <p>
            The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the
            <strong>1960s</strong> when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer
            sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the
            text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on
            templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get
